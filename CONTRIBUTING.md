### Contributing

Prior to writing any code, please discuss with me what you want to do via issue or email (you'll find my email in `project.clj`, as I mentioned). Doing otherwise might result in wasted effort, which is never good.

If you wish to contribute but you don't know what do to, read this: [TODO.md](./TODO.md)
